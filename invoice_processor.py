If multiple pages/images are provided, treat them as ONE invoice — combine all line items from all pages.
The image may be rotated — read it in whatever orientation the text is readable.

CRITICAL — HOW TO READ PRICES ON DOT-MATRIX INVOICES:
- US Foods invoices have columns: ITEM # | DESCRIPTION | PACK/SIZE | ORDERED | SHIPPED | UNIT PRICE | EXTENSION
- SHIPPED = number of cases/units delivered (usually 1-5, small number)
- SOUTHERN GLAZER'S / HORIZON BEVERAGE invoices: Columns are LIST PRICE | POST OFF | DEPOSIT | DISCOUNT | NET PRICE PER CASE | NET PRICE PER BOTTLE | EXTENSION. Use EXTENSION as total_price and NET PRICE PER CASE as unit_price. IGNORE any "Prompt Pay Discount" box — do NOT include it as a line item.
- Before extracting line items, read the column headers to identify which column represents the final billed amount — the amount the restaurant actually owes for that line after all discounts. It may be labeled EXTENSION, EXT, TOTAL, AMOUNT, or TOTAL W/O DEPOSITS. Use that column as total_price.
- Use the column labeled UNIT PRICE, NET PRICE PER CASE, or similar as unit_price.
- Read quantity, unit_price, and total_price for each line directly from the invoice.
- CROSS-CHECK: quantity × unit_price should approximately equal total_price. If they don't match within $0.02, re-read the values. If still mismatched, trust the total_price column and set unit_price = null. NEVER compute unit_price = total_price / quantity — a null unit_price is better than a computed wrong price.
- CRAFT COLLECTIVE HOMEGROWN invoices: Columns are ID | QTY | PRODUCT | UPC | PRICE | DEP | DISC | NET | TOTAL. The PRICE column is the base price per keg, DEP is the keg deposit ($30 per keg), NET = PRICE, and TOTAL = PRICE + DEP. Use TOTAL as total_price and PRICE as unit_price. The line "Beer MA 15.50 Gallons" near the bottom is a deposit summary — do NOT include it as a separate line item. Payment history rows at the bottom (showing dates and invoice numbers like "5/9 921533 ($30.00)") are NOT line items — skip them. Keg deposit credits ("Empty Keg" or "Empty Keg Credit") should be included as negative line items with category NON_COGS.
- MARTIGNETTI COMPANIES invoices: IGNORE any "Prompt Pay Discount" line or box — do NOT include it as a line item. Only extract actual products. For the "total" field, use the "Total Amount Due" box — this is the final amount owed. Do NOT use any gross or pre-discount total. Non-Alcoholic Deposit lines are small surcharges (typically $0.50-$5.00 total) — read the actual deposit amount from the totals/deposit section, do NOT copy a product line's price. Include the deposit as a NON_COGS line item with its correct small amount.
- DEPOSIT RETURNS/CREDITS: If the invoice shows empty keg credits, container credits, or deposit returns, include them as negative line items with category NON_COGS.
- FINAL CHECK: After extracting ALL items, sum all total_price values. This should match the printed subtotal or invoice total (before tax). If off by more than $1, you likely missed an item or misread a digit.

    "invoice_subtotal": null,
    "invoice_total": null,
    "page_info": "Page X of Y if visible, e.g. 'Page 01 of 03'. null if not shown."
}

Rules:
- If a field is not visible, use null
- For dates, convert to YYYY-MM-DD format
- Include ALL line items you can read
- IMPORTANT: Read ALL three columns: SHIPPED QTY, UNIT PRICE, and EXTENSION. Set total_price = extension (read directly). Cross-check: qty × unit_price should ≈ total_price. If not, trust extension and set unit_price = total_price / quantity.
- On US Foods invoices, columns are: SHIPPED QTY | UNIT PRICE | EXTENSION. Read all three, use EXTENSION for total_price.
- On Performance Foodservice invoices, columns are: QTY | UNIT PRICE | EXTENSION — same approach.
- On US Foods invoices, the INVOICE NO field (e.g. 1931359) is the correct invoice_number — NOT the ORDER NUMBER, NOT the ACCOUNT NO, NOT the CUSTOMER NO. The invoice number appears in the header row labeled "INVOICE NO."
- IMPORTANT: Look for service charges, fuel surcharges, delivery fees, environmental fees, or any other charges that appear OUTSIDE the main line items table — often near the subtotal or in a separate section. Include each as a line item with category NON_COGS. These fees are part of the invoice total and must not be missed.
- If you can't read a value clearly, make your best guess and add "(unclear)" to notes
- For pack_size, look for a PACK SIZE, PACK, or UNIT SIZE column (e.g., "4/5 LB", "20/8 OZ", "6/24/1 OZ", "25 LB"). Use null if not visible.
- For ship_to_address, look for "Ship To", "Deliver To", "Sold To", or any delivery/recipient address block. Return the full address as one string (e.g., "746 Main St, Chatham, MA 02633"). Use null if not visible.
- NEVER include the invoice subtotal, tax, total, balance due, or any summary row as a line item. Only include actual purchased products and services/fees. If a row's total_price equals the invoice subtotal or total, it is NOT a line item — skip it.
- IMPORTANT: Include negative line items (credits, deposit returns, empty keg returns). These appear as negative quantities or negative EXT values (e.g. "-1 AB COOPERAGE -50.00", "-5 NON AB COOPERG -250.00"). Capture them with negative total_price values. They are part of the invoice total and must be included for the math to balance. Do NOT skip lines just because they have a negative or zero unit price.
- Combine multi-line item descriptions into one product_name
- For category, classify each item individually:
  - LIQUOR: spirits, vodka, whiskey, rum, tequila, gin, brandy, cordials, bitters
  - BEER: beer, ale, IPA, lager, stout, cider, seltzer, kegs of beer
  - WINE: wine, champagne, prosecco, sparkling wine
  - FOOD: all food items, produce, meat, seafood, dairy, dry goods
  - NA_BEVERAGES: soda, juice, coffee, tea, energy drinks, water, non-alcoholic beer/cocktails
  - TOGO_SUPPLIES: to-go containers, plastic bags, takeout utensils, napkin packs, styrofoam boxes, paper bags, straws, lids
  - DR_SUPPLIES: candles, table covers, cleaning supplies, floor mats, light bulbs, bathroom supplies, menus, table tents
  - KITCHEN_SUPPLIES: aluminum foil, plastic wrap, gloves, sanitizer, trash bags, pan liners, parchment paper, kitchen towels
  - NON_COGS: uniforms, equipment, rent, services, maintenance, landscaping, legal, accounting
- For total_line_items: Look for item count indicators like "Total Items", "Line Items", "Qty Lines", or similar text on the invoice. If you see "47 Items" or "Line Items: 47", extract 47. If no explicit count is printed, count the distinct line items and use that number. Use null if uncertain.
- For invoice_subtotal: Extract the subtotal amount (sum of all items BEFORE tax/fees) exactly as printed on the invoice. Look for "Subtotal", "Merchandise Total", "Items Total", or similar. Use null if not visible.
- For invoice_total: Extract the grand total amount (final amount including tax/fees if present) exactly as printed on the invoice. Look for "Total", "Invoice Total", "Amount Due", "Balance Due", or similar. Use null if not visible.

IMPORTANT — US FOODS INVOICES (multi-page):
US Foods invoices span 3-4 pages. The true invoice total appears on the INVOICE SUMMARY page (usually page 3 or the second-to-last page), labeled "PLEASE REMIT THIS AMOUNT BY [date]  $X,XXX.XX". This is the ONLY value to use as the invoice total and invoice_total.
DO NOT use any of these as the invoice total:
- The "DELIVERY SUMMARY TOTALS" extended price (page 2)
- Any weight values shown in lbs (these are NOT dollar amounts)
- Any per-category subtotals (DRY, REFRIGERATED, FROZEN)
- The "AS SHIPPED DELIVERY AMOUNT" or "DELIVERED AMOUNT"
For US Foods, the subtotal is labeled "Product Total" on the summary page. There may be a "FUEL SURCHARGE" line — include it as a NON_COGS line item, not as tax. Sales tax is typically $0.00 on US Foods food invoices. Do NOT include Sales Tax as a line item — it is already captured in the invoice_tax field.

US FOODS LINE ITEMS:
The DESCRIPTION column contains the product name. It is typically the 5th column after ORD, SHP, ADJ, SALES UNIT, PRODUCT NUMBER. The EXTENDED PRICE (rightmost dollar column) is the line item total. The UNIT PRICE is the second-to-last dollar column. Ignore LABEL, PACK SIZE, CODE, and WEIGHT columns for product data. Use DESCRIPTION as product_name and EXTENDED PRICE as total_price.

UNIFIRST INVOICE RULES:
- UniFirst is a SERVICE invoice (linen/uniform rental). There are NO food items.
- Set category = "NON_COGS" for ALL line items, no exceptions.
- The invoice layout has two totals:
    * "Invoice Total" in the table footer = pre-tax subtotal (use this as invoice_subtotal AND as subtotal)
    * "Total Amount Due" or "Amount Due" at the bottom = after-tax total (use this as invoice_total AND as total)
- DO NOT use "Total Amount Due" as invoice_subtotal — it includes tax.
- invoice_tax / tax is shown in the TAX column on each line (usually $0.00 per item)
  and as a summary line. Sum the tax column for tax.
- Common line item types (all NON_COGS):
    * STOCK items (aprons, shirts, pants) — weekly rental charge
    * Automatic Replacement items — replacement garment fee
    * WET MOP / DRY MOP — cleaning equipment rental
    * TERRY CLOTHS / SHOP TOWELS — towel service
    * AIR FRESH / FRESHENER — air freshener service
    * BAG RACK / HANGER RACK — equipment rental
    * UL (4x6H) — mat rental
    * GMP / GSP / GLP — garment protection charges
    * BOWL CLIP / AIRCLIP — dispenser items

VENDOR ITEM CODE:
- For vendor_item_code, look for a PRODUCT NUMBER, ITEM #, ITEM CODE, CODE, or SKU column on the invoice. This is the vendor's internal product identifier.
- US Foods: Look for the PRODUCT NUMBER column (typically a 7-digit number like "1234567" or "7654321"). It usually appears before the DESCRIPTION column.
- Performance Foodservice / Reinhart: Look for an ITEM # or CODE column (typically 6-7 digits).
- Southern Glazer's / Horizon Beverage: Look for an ITEM or CODE column.
- If no product code column is visible, set vendor_item_code to null for each item."""
